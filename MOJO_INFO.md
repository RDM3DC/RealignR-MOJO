# Mojo Overview

This repository collects resources related to the Mojo programming language. Mojo is designed to combine Python's ease of use with systems level performance.

## Key Features

- **Python compatibility**: Mojo aims for a smooth transition path from existing Python code.
- **Strong performance**: A static type system and compiler optimizations enable high execution speed.
- **AI and ML focus**: Built with modern machine learning workloads in mind.
- **Gradual adoption**: Developers can migrate Python modules incrementally.

## Status

Mojo is currently in active development. Early releases require a registration with Modular and run on Linux environments. Expect rapid iteration as the language matures.
